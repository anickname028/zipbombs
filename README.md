These are some quite silly and quirky zip files which are sometimes marked as malware. Click the links to download them.

ZBLG.zip - 218TB - [here](/zblg.zip)

ZBXL.zip - 4.8PB - incompatible sometimes - [here](https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/zbxl.zip)

42.zip - not here yet - pwd is 42

I do not own any of these and they all could have anything inside.
